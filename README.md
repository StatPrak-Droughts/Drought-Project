## Data

Simulated and measured data at 3 river gauges in hydrological
Bavaria between 1990 and 2020.
The target variable **NM7Q**: lowest 7-day runoff mean of a year (typical
low water characteristic)

## Research Interests

* How can the occurrence of low water events be explained/predicted?
* Which drivers are relevant? 
* Does the significance of the drivers differ between the gauges?

## Analysis

For each of the three levels:

* Adjustment and improvement of the modelling approach (e.g.: can
the relationship between individual drivers and low water be better modelled by smooth effects or a lag structure.)
* Processing and interpretation of the results
* Evaluation of the model approach on observed data

## Goal 
Process understanding for the occurrence of low water and
reality comparison.
